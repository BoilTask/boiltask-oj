## Description

Vasya lives in a round building, whose entrances are numbered sequentially by integers from $1$ to $n$. Entrance $n$ and entrance $1$ are adjacent.

Today Vasya got bored and decided to take a walk in the yard. Vasya lives in entrance $a$ and he decided that during his walk he will move around the house $b$ entrances in the direction of increasing numbers (in this order entrance $n$ should be followed by entrance $1$). The negative value of $b$ corresponds to moving $|b|$ entrances in the order of decreasing numbers (in this order entrance $1$ is followed by entrance $n$). If $b = 0$, then Vasya prefers to walk beside his entrance.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img class="tex-graphics" src="https://r2-oj.boiltask.com/codeforces-659A/380bbd7fcd12a68016a00e8fa2b49e79" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> <span class="tex-font-size-small">Illustration for <span class="tex-span">n = 6</span>, <span class="tex-span">a = 2</span>, <span class="tex-span">b =  - 5</span>.</span></div>

Help Vasya to determine the number of the entrance, near which he will be at the end of his walk.

## Input

The single line of the input contains three space-separated integers $n$, $a$ and $b$ ($1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a ≤ n,  - 100 ≤ b ≤ 100$) — the number of entrances at Vasya's place, the number of his entrance and the length of his walk, respectively.

## Output

Print a single integer $k$ ($1 ≤ k ≤ n$) — the number of the entrance where Vasya will be at the end of his walk.

## Problem Description

Given a positive integer N, you should output the leftmost digit of N^N.

## Input

The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input is a single integer T which is the number of test cases. T test cases follow.  
Each test case contains a single positive integer N(1<=N<=1,000,000,000).

## Output

For each test case, you should output the leftmost digit of N^N.

## Sample Input

```
2
3
4

```

## Sample Output

```
2
2

```

## Hint

  
In the first case, 3 \* 3 \* 3 = 27, so the leftmost digit is 2.  
In the second case, 4 \* 4 \* 4 \* 4 = 256, so the leftmost digit is 2.

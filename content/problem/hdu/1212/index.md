## Problem Description

As we know, Big Number is always troublesome. But it's really important in our ACM. And today, your task is to write a program to calculate A mod B.  
  
To make the problem easier, I promise that B will be smaller than 100000.  
  
Is it too hard? No, I work it out in 10 minutes, and my program contains less than 25 lines.

## Input

The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of two positive integers A and B. The length of A will not exceed 1000, and B will be smaller than 100000. Process to the end of file.

## Output

For each test case, you have to ouput the result of A mod B.

## Sample Input

## Problem Description

\`\`How am I ever going to solve this problem?" said the pilot.  
  
  
Indeed, the pilot was not facing an easy task. She had to drop packages at specific points scattered in a dangerous area. Furthermore, the pilot could only fly over the area once in a straight line, and she had to fly over as many points as possible. All points were given by means of integer coordinates in a two-dimensional space. The pilot wanted to know the largest number of points from the given set that all lie on one line. Can you write a program that calculates this number?  
  
Your program has to be efficient!

## Input

The input consists of multiple test cases, and each case begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of points, followed by N pairs of integers, where 1 < N < 700. Each pair of integers is separated by one blank and ended by a new-line character. No pair will occur twice in one test case.

## Output

For each test case, the output consists of one integer representing the largest number of points that all lie on one line, one line per case.

## Sample Input

```
5
1 1
2 2
3 3
9 10
10 11

```

## Sample Output

```
3

```

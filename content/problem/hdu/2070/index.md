# Fibbonacci Number

## Problem Description

Your objective for this question is to develop a program which will generate a fibbonacci number. The fibbonacci function is defined as such:  
  
f(0) = 0  
f(1) = 1  
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)  
  
Your program should be able to handle values of n in the range 0 to 50.

## Input

Each test case consists of one integer n in a single line where 0≤n≤50. The input is terminated by -1.

## Output

Print out the answer in a single line for each test case.

## Sample Input

```
3
4
5
-1

```

## Sample Output

```
2
3
5
you can use 64bit integer: __int64
```

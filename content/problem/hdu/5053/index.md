## Problem Description

A range is given, the begin and the end are both integers. You should sum the cube of all the integers in the range.

## Input

The first line of the input is T(1 <= T <= 1000), which stands for the number of test cases you need to solve.  
Each case of input is a pair of integer A,B(0 < A <= B <= 10000),representing the range\[A,B\].

## Output

For each test case, print a line “Case #t: ”(without quotes, t means the index of the test case) at the beginning. Then output the answer – sum the cube of all the integers in the range.

## Sample Input

```
2
1 3
2 5

```

## Sample Output

```
Case #1: 36
Case #2: 224

```

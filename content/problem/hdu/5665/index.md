$\\ \\ \\ \\ $For a set of numbers S,we set the minimum non-negative integer,which can't be gotten by adding the number in S,as the lucky number.Of course,each number can be used many times.  
  
$\\ \\ \\ \\ $Now, given a set of number S, you should answer whether S has a lucky number."NO" should be outputted only when it does have a lucky number.Otherwise,output "YES".

## Input

$\\ \\ \\ \\ $The first line is a number T,which is case number.  
  
$\\ \\ \\ \\ $In each case,the first line is a number n,which is the size of the number set.  
  
$\\ \\ \\ \\ $Next are n numbers,means the number in the number set.  
  
$\\ \\ \\ \\ 1\\le n\\le 10^5,1\\le T \\le 10,0\\le a\_i \\le 10^9$.

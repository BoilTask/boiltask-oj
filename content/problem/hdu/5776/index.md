## Problem Description

Given a sequence, you're asked whether there exists a consecutive subsequence whose sum is divisible by m. output YES, otherwise output NO

## Input

The first line of the input has an integer T ($1 \\leq T \\leq 10$), which represents the number of test cases.  
For each test case, there are two lines:  
1.The first line contains two positive integers n, m ($1 \\leq n \\leq 100000$, $1 \\leq m \\leq 5000$).  
2.The second line contains n positive integers x ($1 \\leq x \\leq 100$) according to the sequence.

## Output

Output T lines, each line print a YES or NO.

## Sample Input

```
2
3 3
1 2 3
5 7
6 6 6 6 6

```

## Sample Output

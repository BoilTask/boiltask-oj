## Description

In the following figure, you can see a rectangular card. The width of the card is **W**, length of the card is **L** and thickness is zero. Four **(x\*x)** squares are cut from the four corners of the card shown by the black dotted lines. Then the card is folded along the red lines to make a box without a cover.

Given the width and height of the box, you will have to find the maximum volume of the box you can make for any value of **x**.

## Input

Each case starts with a line containing two real numbers **L** and **W (0 < L, W < 100)**.

## Output

For each case, print the case number and the maximum volume of the box that can be made. Errors less than **10\-6** will be ignored.
